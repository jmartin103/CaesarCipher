# CaesarCipher

Two Python programs to encrypt and decrypt a user-given text file. CaesarCipher.py encrypts a user-given text file, and writes the result to an output text file. CaesarCipher2.py prompts the user for a text file, determines the key from the text, and then uses that key to decrypt the text, writing the result to an output file.
